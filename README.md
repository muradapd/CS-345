# CS-345
Repo for Software Engineering course

These Labs were completed by me and this Project was completed by my class team and I during my Fall 2019 semester at James Madison University

They display my proficiency working with others on a semester long, complex software development project. This course combined all of the knowledge I had gained in my previous CS courses on object oriented programming and algorithms & data structures
